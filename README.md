# Car Race
Fill `lib` with code to build a car race.

You should have:

- a Car class that can accelerate to a certain speed
- a Race class that, once instantiated, instantiates two cars, accelerates them to two random speeds, and picks the faster one
- an instance method on the Race class called `winner` that returns the winning car
- an instance method on the Race class called `loser` that returns the losing car
